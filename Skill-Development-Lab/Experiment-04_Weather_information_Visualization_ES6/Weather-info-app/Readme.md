Program4: Weather Information Visualization Using ES6 Features




Aim

To explore and implement ES6 features such as arrow functions, callbacks, promises, and async/await by developing a weather application that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application includes user input validation and displays weather information graphically using Chart.js.

Technologies Used
•HTML for structuring the application
•CSS for styling and layout
•JavaScript (ES6+) for functionality
•Chart.js for data visualization
•OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data
